Quick Git Guide

git clone http://url.com
	clones a repository

git pull origin branchname
	updates your code with the code on this branch

IMPORTANT: DO THIS EVERY TIME YOU WORK ON A NEW TASK
git branch branchname
	this creates a new branch for you to make changes in (a branch is a basically copy of the current state of the code)
	replace branchname with yourName/taskYouAreDoing
	generally, you should do "git checkout master" before creating a branch, as in:
		git checkout master
		git branch yourName/taskYouAreDoing
		git checkout yourName/taskYouAreDoing
			can be shortened to git checkout -b yourName/taskYouAreDoing (this both creates a branch and checks out that branch)

git checkout branchname
	this makes the branchname your current working branch

git add filename
	adds a file you've modified (files must be added before you can commit)
git add -u
	adds all tracked files you've modified
git add .
	adds all tracked and untracked files you've modified

git stash
	stashes changes you've made (basically saves without committing)
	must be done before checkout out a different branch

git stash apply
	applies changes you've stashed to the current working branch

git commit -m "Commit message goes here"
	commits changes you've made (files must be added first, see above)
	a commit is essentially a "save" of the current state of the code, making it possible to revert to this state if necessary
	for your purposes, a commit message will always be necessary

git status
	gives you the current status of your branch (lists files you've modified and other things you shouldn't need to worry about)

git push origin branchname
	push your working branch (after committing changes) to the remote repository
	once pushed, open a pull request on github
	if you have problems pushing, let me know
