      <br />
      
      <p>Cities around the world are embracing the concept of Open Data, or as data.gov puts it, “A new civic movement that is changing the way citizens experience our nation’s cities.” Open Data is data that “…can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike. ” When this data is made available by federal, state and local governments, citizens, researchers and businesses can create exciting new applications by exploring the interoperability and intersection of different topics.For example, open data has been utilized to determine new ways to zone community school districts, discover innovations that lead to increased public safety, provide transparency in government budgeting and expenditures, and help understand environmental issues. </p>
      <p>This web application was built and designed by the students from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Informatics Capstone LFT Smart City Team for the Lafayette City Government.  The purpose for this web application is to: <br />(1) illustrate the issue of hazardous road conditions and their connection to car accident reports in the city of Lafayette,<br /> (2) propose effective solutions, such as the Waze app community features, to mitigate the aforementioned issue, and <br /> (3) allow citizens and local government officials to interact with this data in an innovative manner.
