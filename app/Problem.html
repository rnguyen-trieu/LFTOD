          <h1>The Problem</h1>
      <br />
           <p>- According to the open data available on the site created for the Cajun Code Fest competition, a social issue facing our community of Lafayette is the road conditions. <br /><br />
- In 2016, <b>34%</b> of all car accidents reported in Lafayette occurred on just ten of the many roads that were reported to have either poor or very poor road conditions. <br /><br />
- According to the Daily Advertiser, <b>60%</b> of major local and state roads in the Lafayette area are in <b>poor or mediocre condition.</b> <br /><br />
- A study released earlier this year shows Lafayette drivers pay an average of <b>$2,024</b> per year because of roads that are deteriorated, congested or lack safety features. <br /><br />
- The correlation between <b>poor road conditions</b> and the number of <b>car accidents</b> needs to be highlighted and discussed amongst both concerned citizens and Lafayette city government officials.
