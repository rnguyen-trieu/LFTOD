          <h1>The Solution</h1>
      <br />
             <p>Waze Connected Citizens Program(CCP) would be a great benefit for the city of Lafayette. <br/>
<br/>
CCP is a free, two-way data exchange empowering municipal decisions to achieve concrete community impact. <br/>
<br/>
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS: Partners receive real-time incident information faster than other reporting methods and accurately pinpoints where incidents occur, creating faster response and clearing times and potentially saving lives.<br/>
<br/>
TWO-WAY DRIVER COMMUNICATION: Partners leverage Waze as a two-way communication channel: Partners use Waze to inform drivers of major traffic events and drivers communicate back real-time road insights through the app.<br/>
<br/>
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING: Insights into locations with frequent congestion or hazards yields smarter urban planning.<br/>
<br/>
BRIDGING CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER PARTNERS: Waze gathers partners via in-person summits and an online forum to discuss case studies and exchange ideas to further impact communities globally.<br/>
<br/>
STREAMLINING DATA INPUTS: Partners can utilize data standards designed by Waze for closure and incident reporting to reduce data fragmentation and promote transport and government data aggregation.</p>
